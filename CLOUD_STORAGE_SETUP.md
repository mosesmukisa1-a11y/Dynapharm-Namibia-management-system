# Cloud Storage Setup for Dynapharm

I'm setting up cloud storage using Google Firebase (Firestore) so your data:
- Never disappears
- Syncs across all devices and browsers
- Is automatically backed up
- Works offline with cloud sync

## What I'm implementing:
1. Firebase Firestore for cloud database
2. Automatic sync between local and cloud storage
3. Offline support with sync when online
4. Real-time updates across devices

This will require:
- A Firebase account (free tier available)
- Configuration credentials

Would you like me to:
A) Create a complete Firebase setup
B) Use a simpler cloud storage solution (like GitHub as database)
C) Set up a backend API server

Which option do you prefer?
